    <h3>A JAM Project fan page</h3>
    <p>Welcome to Motto Motto (that's moe-toe moe-toe), a fan page about my favorite rock band, <b>JAM Project!</b><p>
    <p>It is my mission to gain them more (motto) fans (and me more friends) by sharing my love of their music with the world!</p><br>

    <footer>In the spirit of supporting fellow fans, here's <a href="http://www.jpopasia.com/group/jamproject/">another page on JAM Project!</a> I like that it talks about each member's technical skills and has links to song lyrics, band discography, and articles relating to the band. Layout's a little busy but to each their own!</footer>
